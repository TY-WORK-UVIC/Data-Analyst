Project Summary — Roblox Reviews Sentiment Dashboard (Power BI)

This Power BI project analyzes thousands of Roblox app reviews to uncover player sentiment trends, version performance, and key improvement areas. The dataset includes review text, ratings, likes, app versions, and timestamps. Using Python sentiment analysis (VADER), each review was scored and imported back into Power BI for visualization.

Interactive dashboards display overall satisfaction, average sentiment by app version, top positive/negative feedback, and trends over time. Dynamic slicers and drillthrough pages allow deeper exploration by app version and review rating. KPI cards highlight average rating, sentiment, and engagement, while color-coded charts and word clouds reveal recurring player concerns and praise.

This report demonstrates end-to-end analytical workflow — from data cleaning and text analysis in Python to advanced visualization and storytelling in Power BI — delivering actionable insights that help developers improve user experience and prioritize updates.
